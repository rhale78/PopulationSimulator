# Web Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of web mode for the Population Simulator, as requested in the issue "Add web project razor/blazor page".

## Issue Requirements

✅ **Create a new Blazor project** - Implemented as `PopulationSimulator.Web`
✅ **Backend service for simulation and database** - Shared in `PopulationSimulator.Shared`
✅ **Blazor/Razor for frontend** - Blazor Server components in `PopulationSimulator.Web`
✅ **Preserve console code** - Moved to `PopulationSimulator.Console`
✅ **Split logic into common shared service** - Created `PopulationSimulator.Shared` library
✅ **Both console and web can use shared service** - Both projects reference shared library
✅ **Web mode as complete as console** - All features implemented
✅ **All features functioning properly** - Tested and verified

## Implementation Details

### 1. Project Structure

Created a three-project solution:

```
PopulationSimulator/
├── PopulationSimulator.Shared/      # Shared library
│   ├── Models/                      # Data models (Person, City, etc.)
│   ├── Core/                        # Simulator.cs, NameGenerator.cs
│   ├── Data/                        # DataAccessLayer.cs
│   └── Services/                    # SimulatorService.cs
├── PopulationSimulator.Console/     # Console mode
│   ├── Components/                  # RazorConsole components
│   └── Program.cs
└── PopulationSimulator.Web/         # Web mode (NEW)
    ├── Components/
    │   ├── Pages/Home.razor         # Main simulation page
    │   └── Layout/                  # Layout components
    └── Program.cs
```

### 2. Shared Library (`PopulationSimulator.Shared`)

**Purpose**: Contains all core simulation logic that both console and web modes use.

**Contents**:
- `Core/Simulator.cs` - Main simulation engine with all game logic
- `Core/NameGenerator.cs` - Cultural name generation
- `Data/DataAccessLayer.cs` - SQLite database operations
- `Services/SimulatorService.cs` - Service layer for lifecycle management
- `Models/` - All data models (Person, City, Country, Religion, Job, Invention, War, Dynasty, Event, Law)

**Dependencies**:
- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 9.0.0
- System.Data.SQLite.Core 1.0.118

### 3. Console Mode (`PopulationSimulator.Console`)

**Changes**:
- Renamed from `PopulationSimulator` to `PopulationSimulator.Console`
- Removed Models, Core, Data, Services folders (now in Shared)
- Added project reference to `PopulationSimulator.Shared`
- Kept all RazorConsole components unchanged
- Kept all UI functionality unchanged

**Dependencies**:
- RazorConsole.Core 0.0.3-alpha.4657e6
- Spectre.Console 0.51.1
- PopulationSimulator.Shared (project reference)

### 4. Web Mode (`PopulationSimulator.Web`)

**Implementation**: New Blazor Server application

**Key Features**:

#### Home.razor (Main Simulation Page)
- Real-time dashboard showing all simulation data
- Automatic updates every 500ms via SignalR
- Bootstrap-based responsive design
- Color-coded sections for different data types

**Sections**:
1. **Header Panel** - Current date, generation, speed
2. **Population Statistics** - Total, living, births, deaths, marriages
3. **Civilization Progress** - Cities, countries, religions, inventions, wars
4. **Top Occupations** - Top 5 jobs with counts
5. **Family Tree** - Adam & Eve's lineage (up to 5 levels deep)
6. **Recent Events** - Last 10 events with color-coded badges
7. **Controls** - Speed up/down buttons

#### Program.cs
- Registers `SimulatorService` as singleton
- Configures Blazor Server with interactive components
- Standard ASP.NET Core setup

#### UI Components
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for styling
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Color-coded event badges (green for births, dark for deaths, etc.)
- Real-time updates via `@rendermode InteractiveServer`

**Dependencies**:
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
- PopulationSimulator.Shared (project reference)

### 5. Shared Service Pattern

**SimulatorService.cs** provides:
- `Start()` - Begins simulation loop
- `Stop()` - Stops simulation
- `IncreaseSpeed()` - Increases speed (up to 100x)
- `DecreaseSpeed()` - Decreases speed (down to 1x)
- `OnStatsUpdated` - Event fired when stats change
- `OnSpeedChanged` - Event fired when speed changes
- `GetCurrentStats()` - Returns current SimulationStats

**Used by both modes**:
- Console mode: Subscribes to events, updates RazorConsole UI
- Web mode: Subscribes to events, updates Blazor components via `StateHasChanged()`

### 6. Database

Both modes share the same SQLite database:
- File: `population.db`
- Location: Application directory
- Contains: All people, cities, countries, religions, jobs, inventions, wars, dynasties, events
- Thread-safe: Uses locks in DataAccessLayer
- Periodic sync: Every 100 simulation days

**Warning**: Don't run both modes simultaneously on the same database.

### 7. Testing Results

#### Build Test
```
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

#### Console Mode Test
- Starts successfully
- Welcome screen displays
- Simulation runs
- UI updates in real-time
- Speed controls work

#### Web Mode Test

- Page loads successfully
- Simulation starts automatically
- Real-time updates work (verified population growing)
- Speed controls work (tested speed up button)
- All panels display correctly
- Events update in real-time
- Family tree renders properly

### 8. Documentation

   - How to run each mode
   - Feature descriptions
   - Troubleshooting
   - Customization options

## Feature Parity

| Feature | Console | Web |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Population tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| Birth/death/marriage | ✅ | ✅ |
| Genetic traits | ✅ | ✅ |
| Job system | ✅ | ✅ |
| City founding | ✅ | ✅ |
| Country formation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Religion emergence | ✅ | ✅ |
| Invention discovery | ✅ | ✅ |
| War simulation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Family tree | ✅ | ✅ |
| Recent events | ✅ | ✅ |
| Speed control | ✅ | ✅ |
| Database persistence | ✅ | ✅ |

## Code Quality

- **No code duplication** - All logic in shared library
- **Consistent behavior** - Same engine for both modes
- **Clean separation** - UI separate from business logic
- **Maintainable** - Single source of truth
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new UI modes
- **Well-documented** - Comprehensive documentation

## Performance

Both modes have identical performance:
- Simulation tick rate: 50ms
- UI update rate: 500ms (throttled)
- Speed multiplier: 1x to 100x
- Database sync: Every 100 days
- Memory usage: In-memory collections for speed

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- Pause/resume functionality
- Save/load simulation state
- Multiple simulation profiles
- Export to CSV/JSON
- REST API endpoint
- Real-time multiplayer (web only)
- Mobile app using shared library
- Desktop app using Avalonia/MAUI

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented a complete web-based interface for the Population Simulator while preserving the existing console interface. Both modes share the same robust simulation engine, ensuring consistent behavior and easy maintenance. Users can now choose their preferred interface based on their needs and environment.

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the original issue:
- ✅ New Blazor project created
- ✅ Backend service implemented
- ✅ Console code preserved
- ✅ Logic split into shared library
- ✅ Both modes fully functional
- ✅ Web mode feature-complete
