## Technical Architecture

### Layers
1. **Presentation Layer** (UI/)
   - Console rendering
   - User input handling
   - Statistics display

2. **Business Logic Layer** (Core/)
   - Simulation orchestration
   - Event processing
   - Name generation
   - Rule enforcement

3. **Data Model Layer** (Models/)
   - Entity definitions
   - Relationships
   - Helper methods

4. **Data Access Layer** (Data/)
   - Database operations
   - CRUD operations
   - Transaction management

### Key Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: DataAccessLayer abstracts database operations
- **Event-Driven**: Event logging and processing throughout
- **In-Memory Caching**: Fast simulation with periodic persistence
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries

### Performance Features
- Dictionary lookups for O(1) entity access
- List iteration for bulk processing
- Periodic batched database writes
- Event buffer limiting (1000 events)
