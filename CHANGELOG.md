## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- Initial creation of Advanced Population Simulator
- Core simulation engine with .NET 9 Console application
- Complete data models for all entities:
  - Person with 10+ genetic traits
  - City, Country, Religion, Job, Invention, War, Event, Dynasty, Law
- Trait inheritance system with genetic variation and mutations
- Name generation system with cultural evolution:
  - Patronymic names (early generations)
  - City-based names (middle generations)
  - Occupation-based surnames (later generations)
- Comprehensive life simulation:
  - Birth, death, marriage, pregnancy systems
  - Age-based mortality calculations
  - Job assignment based on traits and age
  - Marriage compatibility rules
- Societal structure simulation:
  - City founding based on population thresholds
  - Country establishment from cities with rulers
  - Religion founding by charismatic individuals
  - Dynasty formation and succession rules
- Technology and conflict systems:
  - Invention discovery by intelligent individuals
  - War simulation between countries
- SQLite database persistence with full schema
- Real-time console UI with:
  - Population statistics display
  - Civilization progress tracking
  - Live event feed with color coding
  - User controls for simulation speed
- Database synchronization every 100 simulated days
- Event logging system with 1000-event memory buffer
- Performance optimizations:
  - In-memory data structures for fast processing
  - Dictionary-based O(1) entity lookups
  - Efficient iteration over collections
- Complete documentation:
  - Comprehensive README with architecture details
  - Quick Start Guide for new users
  - MIT License
- 20+ different job types with unique requirements and risk factors
- Population phase handling:
  - Early population protection (high birth rates, low death rates)
  - Growing population transitions
  - Established civilization dynamics
- Multi-threading for simulation loop and UI updates
- Adjustable simulation speed from 1x to 100x

### Implementation Details
- **Technology Stack**: .NET 9.0, C# 13, SQLite
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Models, Core, Data, and UI layers
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema for all entity types
- **Performance**: Optimized for simulating thousands of individuals efficiently
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy addition of new features

### Key Features
- Emergent complexity from simple rules
- Genetic inheritance with mutations
- Cultural evolution over time
- Dynamic family trees spanning generations
- Realistic population dynamics
- Social structure emergence
- Technological progress
- International conflicts
- Dynasty succession
- Event-driven narrative
