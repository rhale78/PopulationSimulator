# PR Review Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed from PR Review Comment

### 1. Family Tree Display - Male Roots Only ✅
**Issue:** Both Adam and Eve were shown as separate family trees
**Fix:** Modified `GetActiveFamilyTrees()` to filter for `Gender == "Male"` only
- Only male descendants shown as tree roots
- When Adam dies, shows top 10 male descendants with most living children
- Reduced from 2 trees to 1 tree to prevent overflow

### 2. Gender Visualization in Family Tree ✅
**Issue:** No visual distinction between males and females
**Fix:** Added gender symbols to family tree display
- ♂ symbol for males
- ♀ symbol for females
- Makes family structure immediately clear

### 3. Family Tree Overflow Prevention ✅
**Issue:** Family tree could overflow screen with large families
**Fix:** Multiple improvements:
- Limit to 1 family tree displayed (was 2)
- Show up to 10 children per person (increased from 5)
- Depth limited to 3 generations
- Shows "... and X more" for additional children

### 4. Recent Events Not Showing All Events ✅
**Issue:** Only 5 events shown, missing some births visible in family tree
**Fix:** Increased recent events display to 10 (doubled from 5)
- Uses `TakeLast(10)` to show most recent events
- Buffer already held 1000 events, just needed to display more

### 5. UI Corruption and Screen Redraw ✅
**Issue:** Screen could get corrupted, needed better buffering
**Fix:** Implemented proper screen buffering system:
- Added `_screenBuffer` List<string> to ConsoleUI
- Build entire screen content in memory before drawing
- Consistent redraw from buffer prevents corruption
- Attempted to disable console scrolling on Windows (platform-specific)

### 6. Database Migration Error ✅
**Issue:** SQLite Error "table Inventions has no column named HealthBonus"
**Fix:** Added automatic database migration in `InitializeDatabase()`:
```csharp
- Check for missing HealthBonus and LifespanBonus columns using PRAGMA table_info
- Add missing columns with ALTER TABLE if not present
- Graceful error handling for edge cases
```

### 7. "ben Unknown" Last Name Issue ✅
**Issue:** Children showing "ben Unknown" when father dies
**Fix:** Implemented dead people tracking:
- Added `_deadPeopleById` dictionary to track deceased people
- Modified `ProcessDeaths()` to populate dead people dictionary
- Updated `ProcessBirths()` to check both living and dead dictionaries for father lookup
- Fallback chain: PregnancyFatherId (living) → PregnancyFatherId (dead) → SpouseId (living) → SpouseId (dead)

### 8. Pregnancy Continues After Father Dies ✅
**Issue:** Need to ensure pregnancy continues even if father dies during gestation
**Fix:** Enhanced father lookup in `ProcessBirths()`:
- Checks `_deadPeopleById` dictionary if father not found in living people
- Uses father's information from dead dictionary for child's last name
- Pregnancy completes normally with correct patronymic

### 9. Generation Counter Not Active ✅
**Issue:** Generation counter staying at 1 or not incrementing properly
**Fix:** Generation calculation was already correct, verified working:
- `CountGenerations()` recursively calculates lineage depth
- `_generationNumber` updated with each birth
- Screenshot shows "Generation: 2" working correctly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dead People Dictionary
```csharp
private readonly Dictionary<long, Person> _deadPeopleById = new();

// In ProcessDeaths:
if (!_deadPeopleById.ContainsKey(person.Id))
{
    _deadPeopleById[person.Id] = person;
}
```

### UI Buffering System
```csharp
private readonly List<string> _screenBuffer = new();

// Build screen in memory:
_screenBuffer.Clear();
_screenBuffer.Add("Header line...");
// ... build entire screen

// Then draw once:
Console.SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
foreach (var line in _screenBuffer)
{
    Console.WriteLine(line);
}
```

### Database Migration
```csharp
var checkCommand = connection.CreateCommand();
checkCommand.CommandText = "PRAGMA table_info(Inventions)";
// Check for missing columns
// Add with ALTER TABLE if needed
```

## Testing Results

All fixes verified working:
- ✅ Family tree shows only Adam (male root)
- ✅ Gender symbols (♂/♀) displayed correctly
- ✅ Recent events show 10 items including all births
- ✅ Generation counter shows "2" with children born
- ✅ UI renders consistently without corruption
- ✅ Database migration handles existing databases
- ✅ No more "ben Unknown" issues
- ✅ Pregnancies complete even if father dies
